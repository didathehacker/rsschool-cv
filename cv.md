### About me ###
As an MSc Computer Science student at University of Bath I decided to take a short break to focus on web development - to thoroughly study the subject and to implement the techniques in practice by doing an internship. My aim is to work in a frontend team that shares my values of always staying curious, learn from mistakes and professionally grow in a collaborative environment. As a motivated student and mom it is crucial for me to have a responsible and supportive mentor which is the foundation of a good start in the career.
I feel passionale about protecting our climate and raising awareness amongst people in my life.
I enjoy making (and of course eating) pasta, singing in french and occasionaly solving math problems.

### Code example ###
***Codewars challenge:*** Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, 
 and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter  words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed  in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

    def spin_words(sentence):
    list = sentence.split()
    spin_list =[]
    for word in list:
        if len(word)>=5:
            reverse = word[::-1]
            spin_list.append(reverse)
        else:
            spin_list.append(word)
    return " ".join(spin_list)

### ** About me ** ###
As an MSc Computer Science student at University of Bath I decided to take a short break to focus on web development - to thoroughly study the subject and implement the techniques in practice by doing an internship. Currently I am open to frontend internship programmes. My aim is to work in a frontend team that shares my values of always staying curious, learn from mistakes and prosper in a collaborative environment. As a motivated student and mom it is also crucial for me to have a responsible and supportive mentor which is the foundation of a good start in the career.
I feel passionale about protecting our climate and raising awareness amongst people in my life.
I enjoy making (and of course eating) pasta, singing in french and occasionaly solving math problems.

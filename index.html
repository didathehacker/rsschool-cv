        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>As an MSc Computer Science student at University of Bath I decided 
            to take a short break to focus on web development - to thoroughly 
            study the subject and to implement the techniques in practice by 
            doing an internship. My aim is to work in a frontend team that 
            shares my values of always staying curious, learn from mistakes 
            and professionally grow in a collaborative environment. As a 
            motivated student and mom it is crucial for me to have a responsible
            and supportive mentor which is the foundation of a good start in 
            the career. I feel passionale about protecting our climate and 
            raising awareness amongst people in my life. I enjoy making (and of 
            course eating) pasta, singing in french and occasionaly solving 
            math problems.</p>

        <h4>Code Example</h4>
        <p>Codewars challenge: Write a function that takes in a string of one or more 
            words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words 
            reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist 
            of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one 
            word is present.</p>
            <div>def spin_words(sentence):
                list = sentence.split()
                spin_list =[]
                for word in list:
                    if len(word)>=5:
                        reverse = word[::-1]
                        spin_list.append(reverse)
                    else:
                        spin_list.append(word)

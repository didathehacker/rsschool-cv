        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>As an MSc Computer Science student at University of Bath I decided 
            to take a short break to focus on web development - to thoroughly 
            study the subject and to implement the techniques in practice by 
            doing an internship. My aim is to work in a frontend team that 
            shares my values of always staying curious, learn from mistakes 
            and professionally grow in a collaborative environment. As a 
            motivated student and mom it is crucial for me to have a responsible
            and supportive mentor which is the foundation of a good start in 
            the career. I feel passionale about protecting our climate and 
            raising awareness amongst people in my life. I enjoy making (and of 
            course eating) pasta, singing in french and occasionaly solving 
            math problems.</p>

            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>As an MSc Computer Science student at University of Bath I decided 
                to take a short break to focus on web development - to thoroughly 
                study the subject and to implement the techniques in practice by 
                doing an internship. My aim is to work in a frontend team that 
                shares my values of always staying curious, learn from mistakes 
                and professionally grow in a collaborative environment. As a 
                motivated student and mom it is crucial for me to have a responsible
                and supportive mentor which is the foundation of a good start in 
                the career. I feel passionale about protecting our climate and 
                raising awareness amongst people in my life. I enjoy making (and of 
                course eating) pasta, singing in french and occasionaly solving 
                math problems.</p>

            <h4>Code Example</h4>
            <p>Codewars challenge: Write a function that takes in a string of one or more 
                words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words 
                reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist 
                of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one 
                word is present.</p>
